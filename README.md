# Correlation Matrix Visualizaion | Correlogram (Using Stata)

Using the built in Stata dataset (sysuse auto), I generate a weighted visualization of correlation (correlogram) that makes use of color friendly tones with a diverging color palette from blue to brown.

I personally have not seen this visual previously in Stata (if there is one please let me know!).
